# Day 15

## Run

```console
go run main.go < input.txt
```

## Notes

- Nothing really challenging, but fun assignment to work out and worth letting the animation play out in the terminal.
- Detecting movable boxes in a chain was easy enough for part one by using recursion
- Found the answer to part one in about 307Âµs
